# Authentication Middleware Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive authentication and authorization middleware system for the Telegram bot. Non-authorized and banned users now have restricted access to only `/start` and `/info` commands, with all other commands requiring proper authorization.

## Key Features

### üîê Access Control System
- **Non-authorized users**: Can only use `/start` and `/info` commands
- **Banned users**: Can only use `/start` and `/info` commands  
- **Authorized users**: Have access to all bot features
- **Admin users**: Have access to management commands

### üìù Available Commands

#### For Everyone (No restrictions)
- `/start` - Welcome message with appropriate access level information
- `/info` - Detailed profile information with admin contact

#### For Authorized Users Only
- `/balance` - Check account balance
- `/profile` - View profile information

#### For Admin Only (@itsahrabbix)
- `/authorize <telegram_id>` - Authorize a user by their Telegram ID
- `/ban <telegram_id> <reason>` - Ban a user with a specific reason

### üõ°Ô∏è Middleware Features

#### AuthMiddleware (`src/middleware/AuthMiddleware.ts`)
- **Access Validation**: Checks user authorization and ban status before command execution
- **Smart Messaging**: Provides contextual error messages for different restriction types
- **Admin Contact**: Automatically includes admin contact (@itsahrabbix) in restriction messages
- **Command Filtering**: Maintains a whitelist of commands available to unauthorized users

#### Key Middleware Methods
```typescript
checkAccess(msg, command, user) // Returns boolean for access permission
sendRestrictedMessage(msg, reason) // Sends appropriate restriction message
getAdminContact() // Returns admin username
```

### üîÑ User Flow Examples

#### Unauthorized User Experience
1. `/start` ‚úÖ - Shows welcome with limited command list + admin contact
2. `/info` ‚úÖ - Shows profile with authorization status + admin contact  
3. `/balance` ‚ùå - Shows restriction message with admin contact
4. `/profile` ‚ùå - Shows restriction message with admin contact

#### Banned User Experience
1. `/start` ‚úÖ - Shows welcome message
2. `/info` ‚úÖ - Shows profile with ban reason + admin contact
3. Any other command ‚ùå - Shows ban message with admin contact

#### Admin User Experience
1. All regular commands ‚úÖ
2. `/authorize 123456789` ‚úÖ - Authorizes user and notifies them
3. `/ban 123456789 spam behavior` ‚úÖ - Bans user and notifies them

### üéØ Smart Features

#### Dynamic Welcome Messages
- Shows different command lists based on user authorization status
- Includes admin contact for unauthorized users
- Provides clear next steps for users

#### Automatic Notifications
- Users receive notifications when authorized by admin
- Users receive notifications when banned with reason
- Admin gets confirmation of successful actions

#### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of user lookup failures
- Transaction rollback support
- Comprehensive logging of all actions

### üîß Technical Implementation

#### Files Created/Modified
1. **`src/middleware/AuthMiddleware.ts`** - New middleware system
2. **`src/controllers/CommandController.ts`** - Updated with middleware integration
3. Integration with existing User and UserService models

#### Security Measures
- Admin verification through multiple methods (username and role)
- User lookup by Telegram ID for authorization commands
- Proper error messages without exposing system details
- Database transaction safety

### üìä Usage Statistics
- Bot successfully started and running
- Middleware automatically applied to all commands
- Clean separation of concerns between authentication and business logic
- Zero breaking changes to existing user experience for authorized users

## Admin Commands Reference

### Authorize User
